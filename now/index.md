# This is my now page

It's a place where I publicly declare what I'm doing in my spare time, that I can use to keep myself focused and hopefully finish more things.

* Setting up this site: My number 1 technical meta priority, before I do anything else, is getting this site setup properly.
I want this to be a place I can blog, have personal wiki pages, host content and experiment.
I want to do this first before I embark on anything new and significant, so I can capture my progress.

* Training for 2 Ultra Marathons in April and May: Mt Solitary and UTA100 (was North Face 100).

* Testing....

* Testing 2...

* testing 3
