## This is my now page

To make the most of my career break, I want to spend as much spare time as possible focusing on new experiences that help me learn
and have fun. I liked the idea (link) of publicly declaring this to keep myself honest

* Setting up this site: A bit of a 'meta goal', but my number 1 technical priority, before I get carried away doing
anything else, is getting this site setup properly. Overall, I want this to be a site where I can:
** Host static content, that I can easily update
** Keep track of the things I'm doing and learning
** Blog and publish my experiences that I think are worthwhile
**
I want this to be a place I can blog, have personal wiki pages, host content and experiment.
I want to do this first before I embark on anything new and significant, so I can blog about the stuff I'm doing.
Once it's reasonable, I'll write up the tech I've used to get it working well.

* Training for my next 100km run
Training for the Ultra Trail Australia 100km is taking up a fair amount of my free activity time at the moment. After this, I don't have any short term running goals.

* Reading these books:
[Reinventing Organisations - Frederic Laloux](http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501). I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk) from Frederic a while back, loved it and want to find out more.
[Buddhism for Busy People - David Michie](http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-Busy-People-Happiness-Uncertain/dp/1559392983). I'd like to spend more time meditating, and I have this lying around the house, so it might encourage me.
