## This is my now page

Here is the list of major projects I'm currently working on. I'd planned to keep this regularly updated, but I initially failed, so here goes attempt number 2..


- Developing Code Club: I've been running a Code Club at my kids' school for the last 6 months, which I need to develop further. More info here:

- Looking into Robots: We recently bought a GoPiGo3, mainly to experiment with robots and coding with my kids, but as it's so new, it's proving an interesting learning experience for myself.

- Computer Vision RC Car Lap Timer: My pet coding project at the moment is to learn about computer vision using the OpenCV libraries to build a webcam lap timer for my RC Car track with a Raspberry Pi. More info on this when it's in a fully working state.

- Reviewing a book. One of my friends is writing a book on Digital Leadership. Although I'm not currently working in this area, it's something I still have a lot of interest in, so I'm reading along as he writes and edits it, both for learning and to help provide feedback.

- Financial Independence learning. I've become a lot more interested in this field since I've not been working and spend a fair amount of time thinking about it and how it applies. I wrote a post a while back on the topic and since then I've been listening to a lot of podcasts. I need to write more about this too.
