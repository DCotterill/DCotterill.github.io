## This is my now page

Here is the list of major projects I'm currently working on. I'd planned to keep this regularly updated, but I initially failed, so here goes attempt number 2...


- Developing [Code Club](https://codeclubau.org/): I've been running a Code Club at my kids' school for the last 6 months, which I need to develop further. More info in a post soon.

- Looking into Robots: We recently bought a [GoPiGo3](https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo3/), mainly to experiment with robots and coding with my kids, but as it's so new, it's proving an interesting learning experience for myself.

- Computer Vision RC Car Lap Timer: My pet coding project at the moment is to learn about computer vision using the OpenCV libraries to build a webcam lap timer for my RC Car track with a Raspberry Pi. More info on this when it's in a fully working state. There's an amazing amount of information at [PyImageSearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/) for people interested in this stuff.

- Slowly progressing through the infamous Andrew Ng [Coursera Machine Learning course](http://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). I find this very interesting, but can't find the time to progress as quickly as I'd like at the moment. 

- Reviewing a book. One of my friends is writing a book on Digital Leadership. Although I'm not currently working in this area, it's something I still have a lot of interest in, so I'm reading along as he writes and edits it, both for learning and to help provide feedback.

- Financial Independence learning. I've become a lot more interested in this field since I've not been working and spend a fair amount of time thinking about it and how it applies. I wrote a post a while back on the topic and since then I've been listening to a lot of podcasts. I need to write more about this too.

- My current reading list can be found on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/63849894-darren-cotterill?shelf=currently-reading&utm_campaign=mybooksnav&utm_content=mybooks_cta&utm_medium=web&utm_source=homepage&view=covers)
