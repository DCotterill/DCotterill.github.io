## This is my now page

To make the most of my career break, I want to spend as much spare time as possible focusing on new experiences that help me learn
and have fun. I liked the idea (link) of publicly declaring this to keep myself honest.

All the things on this list are 'spare time' at the moment until I finish work in July, and after that take a 'do nothing' break for a month or so. After that, it will become my main list of significant projects.

- Setting up this site: A bit of a 'meta goal', but my number 1 technical priority, before I get carried away doing anything else, is getting this site setup properly. A few overall goals:
	- Host static content, that I can easily update (mostly done)
    - Keep track of the things I'm doing and learning (possible, needs content)
    - Blog and publish my experiences that I think are worthwhile (possible, needs content)
    - Work on some ways of including dynamic content. I've done [this](/scratch/strava-elevation.html) already, but have some more ideas for content I want to include.

- Site content. A few things in draft stage which need more time:
 - Personal content. 'About me, this page, plans, etc'
 - Blog post about how I set this site up, and which tech I used, in particular how I've published dynamic content from processes scheduled from Heroku
 - Blog post about quitting Optiver and what I plan to do in my career break

- I currently have these books on the go:
 - [Reinventing Organisations - Frederic Laloux](http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501). I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk) from Frederic a while back, loved it and want to find out more.
 - [Buddhism for Busy People - David Michie](http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-Busy-People-Happiness-Uncertain/dp/1559392983). I'd like to spend more time meditating, and I have this lying around the house, so it might encourage me.
