# This is my now page

It's a place where I publicly declare what I'm doing in my spare time, that I can use to keep myself focused and hopefully finish more things.

* Setting up this site: My number 1 technical priority is getting this site setup how I want. I want this to be a place I can blog, have personal wiki pages, host content and experiment.

* Training for 2 Ultra Marathons in April and May: Mt Solitary and UTA100 (was North Face 100).
