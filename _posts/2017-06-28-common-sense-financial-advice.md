## Some not so common sense financial advice.

I recently came across this 'financial advice' article, which has luckily received the criticism it deserves, but I feel so strongly that it's offering such poor recommendations to people that I have to write both a rebuttal and a some basic thoughts on what I think people should do.

There are a lot of good financial advice blogs, books, articles out there (some linked at the end of this post), but I want to add my perspective to as another fight against this nonesense.

My credentials here are that I consider myself somewhat financially independent (not rich!), by which I consider that I don't need to work to earn money if I don't want to, which I beleive I have achieved mainly through following good personabl finance habits, and partly through the luck of a career in a well paying domain.

I'll start with some of my high level advice then go into a re-buttal of the points in the article so you can see how they are the exact opposite of what I would recommend.

Unfortunatly, the video at the top of the article actually seems to offer sensible, albeit 
- Spend less than you earn

Impact of large changes

- Invest wisely and compound interest

Diversification
Don't time the market
Index funds
Tax strategies
Exponential growth

- Setting goals that are easier than you think

Achieving financial independence, against the norm - blogs

- 



The only perspected I think deserves some more thought from the article is the point about 'being money'.. there is a case of imposter syndrome which people need to get over.
