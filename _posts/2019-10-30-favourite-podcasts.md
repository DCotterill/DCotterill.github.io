## My Favourite Podcasts

I spend a fair amount of time listening to podcasts. I find I can steadily run and take in the information at the same time, so on heavy running weeks, my long runs can get through a few hours of podcast material.

The stuff I listen to often provides advice, whether it's technical, health, financial, etc., so I often find myself sharing episodes, or whole series, with people.

I thought I'd compile this list to make that sharing a little easier:

[Broken Brain with Dhru Purohit](https://drhyman.com/broken-brain-podcasts/)

This is a health and nutrition podcast which my wife put me onto (she's currently studying to be a nutritionist). Lots of really interesting and practical info.

I've only listened to about 5 episodes so far, but they've all been good, so I'll definitely work my way through the backlog.

Some of my favs you could start with:
[How a Morning Routine, Human Touch, and Nourishing Relationships Can Radically Lower Your Stress with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee](https://drhyman.com/blog/2019/10/10/bb-ep75/)

[E70: A Step-by-Step Approach to Personalizing Your Diet with Chris Kresser](https://drhyman.com/blog/2019/09/05/bb-ep70/)
