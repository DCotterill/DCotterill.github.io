## My Favourite Podcasts

I spend a fair amount of time listening to podcasts. I find I can steadily run and take in the information at the same time, so on heavy running weeks, my long runs can get through a few hours of podcast material.

The stuff I listen to often provides advice, whether it's technical, health, financial, etc., so I often find myself sharing episodes, or whole series, with people.
