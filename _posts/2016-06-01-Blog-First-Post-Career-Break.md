After almost 20 years of full time work in the IT industry, I made the decision to quit my highly paid IT job with nothing to go to.

I want to avoid sounding like every other priveliged ass-hat out there <link>, but I do feel slightly blessed that my career and lifestyle choices afford me this option, so I intend to make the most of it.

The first obvious question everyone asks is 'what are you going to do next?' It's easy to reply 'nothing' or 'not sure yet' as most people don't seem to quite understand that I'm not just looking to move to another 'better' IT job.

I don't want to say much about why I'm leaving my current company specifically, I'll consider writing about my experiences at Optiver once I've had time to contemplate after leaving. It's genuinely confusing for some people to hear I'm voluntarily leaving a role with benefits like free lunch and breakfast, amazing office, gym membership, weekly massages, annual trips away, regular dinners and parties and large bonuses, but it's clear that once you have these things they become the 'new norm' and don't really feel like a benefit any more. 

So..looking forward to July. What *will* I be doing? I expect to spend 9-12 months not working for a company. This doesn't necessarily mean I won't be doing any work, but I'll be aiming to follow MMM's advice of only doing stuff I'd do for free, and not feel compelled to do something <other link>

Here's a list of high level goals I have during that time.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/relax.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Relax**. I always crave breaks, days off and holidays to really relax and slow down. I'm the type of person who tries to squeeze as much as possible out of my time, which means at weekends I'm always trying to get the family to do something or go somewhere. If I'm not doing that, there's 1 million things I should be doing around the house, etc. I'm hoping this freedom will remove the guilt of the occasional 'nothing day' where I don't feel like I'm wasting a valuable day off if I don't achieve something big.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/to-do-list.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Reduce my life debt**. I'm in inherently responsible person who worries about things not getting done. When you work full time there's a backlog of 'life tasks' that build up, such as house chores, meeting old friends, exercise, etc. I want to pay down that debt of 'stuff', so when I have something truly inspiring I want to do, I'm not distracted by the million other things I feel I should be doing.

<div style="height:150px;  width:150px; overflow:hidden; align:left; float:left">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/family-time.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Familiy time**.
I have a 7yo son and a 5yo daughter. I've been lucky to have fairly normal working ours, little work
travel, etc. over the past 10 years, so I manage to spend time with my kids most days already. I still feel I can be a better Dad, focussing more time on my kids and their needs. Being less stressed and having more time available can only help me make this time better for them, and me. I'm sure an stressed, exhausted Dad is less fun than they can be.

<div style="height:150px;  width:150px; overflow:hidden; align:left; float:left">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/coding-beach.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Tech time. Ideas, technology**. The last several years of my career have moved me more to management than technology, but I still get excited by new tech and building things. The annual 'innovation day' at work, when I actual get to code and build something is my favourite day of the year. I want to spend more time programming and experimenting to see if it's something I enjoy again if I do it more often.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<div style="height:150px;  width:150px; overflow:hidden; align:left; float:left">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/running.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Activities time**. I love running, but always feel crammed to fit it in around my work schedule and never feel like I reach my full potential. I want to do more, but also spend time doing more outdoor activities which make me happy. Cycling, swimming, surfuing, bush walking, kayaking, climbing.. in Sydney the list is endless. 

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mooc.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Learning**.
Almost every day I see a new online course, tech book, conference talk to add to my learning list. I try, but fail pretty badly at getting through anything on the list. I suspect I'll find it fairly difficult to self motivate to do this, even with lots of time, but I'm going to set myself some goals and try my best.

- Future work planning.. maybe not for 6 months.

The second thing people say to me after I announce my plans is 'You'll get bored in a few months'. Looking at that list of plans, I don't think that will happen any time soon.

During my time off, I'm hoping to keep an up-to-date list of:
- Things I'm focussing on now.
- Plans that I'd like to do.
