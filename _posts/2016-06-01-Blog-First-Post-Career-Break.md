After almost 20 years of full time work in the IT industry, I made the decision to quit my highly paid job with nothing
to go to.

I want to avoid sounding like every other priveliged ass-hat out there <link>, but I do feel slightly blessed that my career
and lifestyle choices afford me this option, so I intend to make the most of it.

The first obvious question everyone asks is 'what are you going to do next?' It's easy to reply 'Nothing' or 'Not sure'
as most people don't seem to quite understand that I'm not just looking to move to another 'better' IT job.

I don't want to say much about why I'm leaving my current company specifically, my experiences there will come out in
a later post once I've had time to contemplate after leaving. It's genuinely confusing for some people to hear I'm
voluntarily leaving a role with benefits like free lunch and breakfast, amazing office, gym membership, weekly massages,
annual trips away, regular dinners and parties and large bonuses, but it's clear that once you have these things they
become the 'new norm' and don't really feel like a benefit any more. Capitalism at it's worst. <link>

So..looking forward to July. What *will* I be doing? I expect to spend 9-12 months not working for a company. This doesn't
necessarily mean I won't be doing any work, but I'll be aiming to follow MMM's advice of only doing stuff I'd do for free
(but I'll charge for it of course) <other link>

Some goals:

- Relax. I always crave breaks and days to really relax and slow down. I'm the type of person who tries to squeeze as
much as possible out of my time, which means at weekends I'm always trying to get the family to do something or go
somewhere. If I'm not doing that, there's 1 million things I should be doing around the house, etc. I'm hoping this
 freedom will remove the guilt of the occasional 'nothing day'

- Reduce my life debt. I'm in inherently responsible person who worries about things not getting done. When you work full
time there's a backlog of 'life tasks' that build up, such as house chores, commms with friends, exercise, etc. I want to
pay down that debt, so when I have something truely inspiring I want to do, I'm not distracted by the million other things

- Familiy time. I have a 7yo son and a 5yo daughter. I've had the benefits of fairly normal working ours, little work
travel, etc. so I manage to spend time with my kids most days already, but I want to be calm dad, not stressed dad. Have
some prep time in how to be energetic with them, not exhausted. Put some learning plans into action

- Tech time. Ideas, technology

- Managing money time. Create freedom and passive income streams

- Cooking time

- Future work planning.. maybe not for 6 months.

The second thing people say to me after I announce my plans is 'You'll get bored in a few months'. Looking at that list
 of plans, I think not.
