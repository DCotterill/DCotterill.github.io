After almost 20 years of full time work in the IT industry, I've made the decision to quit my job with nothing else to go to.

I consider myself very lucky that my choice of career pays well enough to allow me the opportunity to not work for a while, so I intend to make the most of it.

The first obvious question everyone asks is 'What are you going to do next?' It's easy to reply 'nothing' or 'not sure yet' as most people don't seem to quite understand that I'm not doing the usual thing and looking to move to another 'better' IT job.

I wont say much yet about why I'm leaving my current company. I'll consider writing about my experiences at Optiver once I've had time to contemplate when I've actually left. It seems genuinely confusing for some people to hear I'm voluntarily leaving a role with benefits like free lunch and breakfast, amazing office, gym membership, weekly massages, annual trips away, regular dinners and parties and large bonuses, but it's clear that once you have these things for a while they become the 'new norm' and don't really feel like a benefit any more. 

So.. I have 2 weeks left. What *will* I be doing? It's hard to predict, but at the moment I expect to spend at least 9-12 months not working for a company. This doesn't necessarily mean I won't be doing any work, but I'll be aiming to follow some good advice of [only doing stuff I'd do for free, and not feel compelled to do something.](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/04/15/great-news-early-retirement-doesnt-mean-youll-stop-working): 

From my thinking so far, here's a list of high level goals I have during that time.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/relax.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Relax**. I always crave breaks, days off and holidays to really relax and slow down. I'm the type of person who tries to squeeze as much as possible out of my time, which means at weekends I'm always trying to get the family to do something or go somewhere. If I'm not doing that, there's a million things I should be doing around the house, etc. I'm hoping this freedom will remove the guilt of the occasional 'nothing day' where I don't feel like I'm wasting a valuable day off if I don't achieve something big.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/to-do-list.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Reduce my life debt**. I generally worry about stuff not getting done. When you work full time there's a backlog of 'life tasks' that build up, such as house chores, meeting friends, exercise, a lifetime of digital photos, etc. I want to pay down that debt of 'stuff', so when I have something truly inspiring I want to do, I'm not distracted by the million other things I feel I should be doing instead.

I have a 7yo son and a 5yo daughter. I've been lucky to have fairly normal working hours and very little work travel over the past 10 years, so I manage to spend time with my kids most days already. I still feel I can be a better Dad, focusing more time on my kids and their needs. Being less stressed and having more time available can only help me make this time better for them, and me. I've ventured into getting them coding already, but there is so much more I could do with a calm mind and a bit of spare time.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/coding-beach.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Tech time. Ideas, technology**. The last several years of my career have moved me more to management than technology, but I still get excited by new tech and building things. The annual 'innovation day' at work, when I actual get to code and build something turns out to be my favourite day of the year. I plan to spend more time programming and experimenting to see if it's something I enjoy again if it's just because it's a break from the norm. Python seems to be my go-to productive language at the moment, but I'd like to use a functional language to do something real, so will most likely learn some Elixir/Phoenix to keep up with the cool kids.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/running.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Activities time**. I love [trail running](blog/2016/05/31/Scratch-Elevation-Marathon) and outdoor activities, but always feel crammed to fit them in around my work schedule and never feel like I reach my full potential. I want to do more, but also spend time doing more outdoor activities which make me happy. Cycling, swimming, surfing, bush walking, kayaking, climbing.. in Sydney the list is endless.

Almost every day I see a new online course, tech book, conference talk to add to my learning list. I try, but fail pretty badly at getting through anything on the list (My Pocket un-read count is 3,412!!). I suspect I'll find it fairly difficult to self motivate to do this, even with lots of time, but I'm going to set myself some goals and try my best. By being a bit more focused and managing my time better, I hope I can build learning new things into my permanent schedule.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/blog.jpg" width="150px" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/></div>**Publishing**.
I've always thought about blogging and publishing my ideas and experiences, but it's never quite made it high enough in my priorities. This is the best chance I'll get to give it a shot. My plan is to use this site to capture [my plans](/plans) and eventually write some personal and technical blog posts.

I'm very lucky I can afford the time to not work. At the moment, I expect this to be a temporary situation as [my wife's recruitment business](http://www.2degreesrecruitment.com.au/) <link> keeps us financially secure. Even after 12 months though, I want to be in a position where I don't have to work unless I want to, so I need to spend some time doing some budgeting to work out what we can cut back on that won't affect our lifestyle too much, and whether I can improve my passive income streams from current investments. I've always been fairly frugal; I don't like fancy restaurants, expensive clothes, or even expensive holidays, but I'm sure there's still a lot of waste in our outgoings. This will give me a much clearer picture of long term financial goals and how to achieve them.

The second thing people say to me after I announce my plans is 'You'll get bored in a few months and be looking for a new job'. The more I think about it, I don't think that will happen any time soon.

During my time off, I'm hoping to keep an up-to-date list of:
- Things I'm focusing on [now](/now).
- [Plans](/plans) that I'd like to do.

I have 2 weeks left of work, so for at least the first month I'll be prioritising the 'relax' goal fairly highly, so I'm straigt off to New Zealand with the family for a week of snowboarding :-)

Hopefully after that, this site will take some shape and I'll be doing something useful worth writing about here.
