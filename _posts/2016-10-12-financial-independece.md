I've always felt a little different to the majority of people in my attitude to money and spending. I've always been a saver from an early age, been bewildered when I see people racking up credit card debt and even felt uneasy paying the bank interest on a mortgage. I recently discover [Mr Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/), a Financial Freedom blogger who retired at 30 and now has around 50,000 visitors to his site every day!

His tagline _'Financial Freedom through Badassity'_ aims to help others achieve the same freedom that MMM has, and tries to convice everyone that it's actually quite an easy goal, which most people don't beleive, and that 'buying more stuff' is not the way to happiness anyway.

Recently he recorded a video talk that expresses these ideas really simply. I won't summarise it here or spoil his punchlines, so watch the talk (it's only 25 mins, and quite entertaining), then my thoughts and additions follow..

so.. (hopefully you watched the video :-))

Every aspect of this talk gels with me completely. Since I've not been working my attitude towards commercialism and buying stuff has become even stronger. Not because I want to be more frugal, but because I think when you're working hard to earn money, then buying things seems like some kind of 'reward' for the hard work. When you're not working you just want to protect that freedom by not wasting money on stuff you don't really need that doesn't make you happy anyway. I found myself in a Westfield mall a few weeks ago and I literally felt sick walking around the shops looking at how expensive 'fashion' is, and that so many people get sucked into buying this stuff when they can't afford it at all. I find it genuinely confusing how some people find shopping fun.

This slide resonated with me particularly. Maybe I should get a custom credit card with this picture on it :-)

The personal debt aspect is particularly important for Australia, as we have the **highest personal debt in THE WORLD!**. When I wrote this the personal debt on [Australian Debt Clock](http://www.australiandebtclock.com.au/clocks) was $145 billion of which $43 billion was credit card debt! Just visit that site and see the numbers tick over to get a shock.

I also particularly like his response to people who say 'but I really like my job'. There's so much truth in the answer that financial freedom doesn't stop you working, it just removes ties to opens up a world of opportunities and possibilities.
