## Adventures in Code Club

One of the goals I had when finished up at work was to start a Code Club at my kids' school. For various reasons (schools are harder to organise than you think!), it took me a little longer than expected, but I've now been doing it for almost 2 school Terms. Everyone I talk to about it finds it interesting, especially people with kids, so it's about time I wrote a little about it..

I've learned a lot over the last few months, so I plan to write a series of posts, starting with this one explaining the basics of what a Code Club is, and why I think it's important..
