# Things I want to do

Here's my main to-do list. It's not for daily 'pay a bill' type Todos, but major stuff like learning new skills, and starting new projects.

It's my backlog of large stuff, which eventually I hope will make it onto my [now page.](/now)

## Technical

* Setup some home automation tech. I'd like to play with [OpenHAB](www.openhab.org) and some basic controlling devices
* Setup my Raspberry Pi as a media server (it's been sitting in my drawer for a year)
* Build a site for to graph my Strava metrics. e.g. Kms climbed per year burn up chart
* Learn a new language properly. Possibly Elm, Elixir
* Play around with my LeapMotion (also been in a drawer gathering dust) to see if I can use it for anything useful

## Family

* Do more code.org with my kids, and capture the experiences. Write up a page of kids resources for coding and tech stuff (I have links to heaps)

## Community

* Start a [CodeClub](http://www.codeclubau.org/) at my kids' school. Ideally last term of 2016
* Follow my wife's lead and teach Ethics classes

## Home projects

* Build an RC car track in my loft. I have approx 5x10m space I could use for a track. Would love to have a FPV experience for car racing
* Properly sort out my home veggie garden. I have one, but results are paltry so far.

## Learning

* Spend some time working on Machine Learning / AI Projects, mainly just for fun
* Learn to play the Ukelale, so I can help teach my daughter

## Physical

* Learn to swim properly, so I can enter a Triathlon, or potentially an IronMan. Goal to do the [Bondi to Bronte](http://www.bonditobronte.com.au/) Swim in 2016
* Learn to surf properly. I have a board, but I'm crap
* Do more meditation and commit to a schedule to create a habit and improve. Have done a little [Headspace](www.headspace.com) and I like it, but I need to invest more time
