# Things I want to do

Here's my main to-do list. It's not where I keep the 'pay a bill' type things, but major stuff like learning new skills, starting new projects, etc.

I expect some of these to be interesting enough to spark some write ups or blog entries.

## Technical

* Learn a new language properly. Possibly Elm, Elixir, Go.
* Setup my Raspberry Pi as a media server (it's been sitting in my drawer for a year)
* Play around with my LeapMotion (also been in a drawer gathering dust) to see if I can use it for anything useful
* Build a site for to graph my Strava metrics. e.g. Kms climbed per year burn up chart.

## Community

* Start a CodeClub at my kids' school

## Family

* Do more code.org with my kids, and capture the experiences. Write up a page of kids resources for coding and tech stuff (I have links to heaps)

## Home projects

* Build an RC car track in my loft. I have approx 5x10m space I could use for a track. Would love to have a FPV experience for car racing.

## Learning

* Machine Learning?
* Learn to play the Uke - just to help /teach my daughter


## Physical

* Learn to swim properly, so I can enter a Triathlon, or potentially an IronMan
* Do more meditation and commit to a schedule to create a habit and improve. Have done a little Headspace and I like the idea, just not done enough yet.
