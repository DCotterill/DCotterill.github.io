## Who am I?

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/about/Cotterill-Family-342.jpg" height="500" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px;"/>I'm Darren Cotterill, born in Birmingham, England and now live in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia.

I went to Worcester Royal Grammar School, then moved to Manchester University to study a Computer Science degree
and spent my student grant on beer and clubbing.

Since moving to Australia, I've married my wife Diane <link> and now have 2 kids that take a lot of my time, love and attention.
Work wise, I've been a programmer, tech lead, project manager, development manager in consulting roles at LogicaCMG <link>
and ThoughtWorks <link> and most recently worked as a Development Manager at Optiver, a private trading company.

In 2016 I decided I needed a career break after almost 20 years on continuous office working to decide what I want
to do next <blog link>, while I'm supported by my wife's tech recruitment business <link>

I love the outdoors which I why Sydney is so great. I run a lot <link> in national parks, mountain bike, surf (badly,
but hope to improve).

As a child I spent most weekends coding on a C64 and BBC micro with my best friend, building games and graphics demos.
This has left me very passionate about teaching my kids to code, and plan to progress this a lot further in my new found spare time.

New tech excites me, and although my recent jobs have been more manager than programmer, I still like to code every
now and again, and hope to do more. Maybe even get a job one day :-)
